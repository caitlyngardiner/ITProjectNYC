  <h3>Getting Around</h3>

<div class = "allimages">
  <img  src = "resources/taxi.jpg" alt= "taxi" class = "myimage"/>
  <div class = "mytext">
  <p>The iconic yellow taxi is certainly a popular way to get around the city with residents and visitors alike. The yellow taxi is easy to recognise, being bright yellow, and having a yellow light on the roof. These yellow taxis are the only vehicles that are allowed to pick passengers up in response to a street hail across the entire city.</p>
  </div>
  <img  src = "resources/bike.jpg" alt= "bike" class = "myimage"/>
    <div class = "mytext">
  <p>Like many cities around the world, New York has a bike hire program whereby you can get access to a large network of bikes located around the city, which you can drop off and pick off at various points. The Citi Bike program is open to both locals and visitors. At time of writing, it’s $12 for a day pass, and $24 for a 3 day pass. These passes can be bought through the Citi Bike Mobile App, or in person at a station kiosk (see kiosks here). Annual memberships are also available, which are more suited to residents or those staying longer term in the city, and you can sign up for those on the official website.</p>
  </div>
  <img  src = "resources/bus.jpg" alt= "bus" class = "myimage"/>
      <div class = "mytext">
  <p>  The New York Metropolitan Transport Authority (MTA) operates a fleet of almost 6,000 buses in New York, which cover over 322 routes. Suffice to say, you should be able to find a bus route to meet your needs! Buses in New York are generally classified as local or express. Express routes have reduced stops and focus on serving commuter routes from some of the busier areas of Manhattan to the outer boroughs.</p>
  </div>
  <img  src = "resources/subway.jpg" alt= "subway" class = "myimage"/>
        <div class = "mytext">
  <p>One of the most popular ways to get around New York is the New York Subway. This is a great way to get around the city as you avoid any traffic. With 472 subway stations, the New York City subway is the largest subway system in the world as measured by total number of stations. It’s also one of the oldest subway systems in the world, as well as one of the busiest. It’s operates twenty four hours a day across 36 lines, and serves four out of five of New York’s boroughs.</p>
  </div>
  <img  src = "resources/ferry.jpg" alt= "ferry" class = "myimage"/>
          <div class = "mytext">
  <p>There’s a lot of water in New York, and as a result, there are a variety of options for using boats to get around the city, including the NYC Ferry service and Staten Island Ferry. The NYC Ferry is a relatively recent addition to New York’s public transport system. Launched in 2017, at time of writing this offers four lines, with two additional lines planned to open. There are 21 terminals and 23 boats in operation, connecting Manhattan with Brooklyn and Queens.</p>
  </div>
  <img  src = "resources/rail.jpg" alt= "rail" class = "myimage"/>
          <div class = "mytext">
  <p>As well as the subway, there are a number of passenger railway lines operating around New York city. The majority of these are commuter focused lines designed to bring people into the city from the more distant boroughs, and they include the NYC suburban train, Staten Island Railway, New Jersey Transit, Port Authority Trans-Hudson, Long Island Railroad and Metro North Railroad. Unless you are planning on visiting one of the more distant part of the city, or have booked a hotel a long way from the main sights in New York, it’s unlikely you’re going to need to use one of these rail services. If you do, you will most likely have to buy a ticket for the individual journey at the train station. There is also an eticketing app called eTix, available for both Android and iPhone devices, which lets you buy tickets on your phone for the Metro-North Railroad or Long Island Rail Road. Fares will vary depending on the route you take.</p>

  <img  src = "resources/uber.jpeg" alt= "uber" class = "myimage"/>
        <div class = "mytext">
  <p>Whether you're headed to work, JFK, LGA, EWR, or out on the town, Uber connects you with a reliable ride—from low-cost uberX and uberXL to premium UberBLACK and UberSUV—in minutes. One tap and a car comes directly to you. Your driver knows exactly where to go. And payment is completely cashless.</p>
</div>
  <img  src = "resources/lyft.jpg" alt= "lyft" class = "myimage"/>
          <div class = "mytext">
  <p>Whether you’re riding to get your pastrami fix, catch a dance show in Bushwick, or take a nature break upstate, count on Lyft for reliable, affordable rides in minutes. The Lyft app matches you with local drivers in just a few taps. Request, ride, then simply pay in the app.</p>
