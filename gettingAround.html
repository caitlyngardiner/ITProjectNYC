With 472 subway stations, the New York City subway is the largest subway system in the world as measured by total number of stations. It’s also one of the oldest subway systems in the world, as well as one of the busiest. It’s operates twenty four hours a day across 36 lines, and serves four out of five of New York’s boroughs. The subway system is designed such that you can get to anywhere in New York City. There's no where you can't go!</p>

  <img  src = "resources/ferry.jpg" alt= "ferry" class = "myimage"/>
          <div class = "mytext">
  <p>There’s a lot of water in New York, and as a result, there are a variety of options for using boats to get around the city, including the NYC Ferry service and Staten Island Ferry. The NYC Ferry is a relatively recent addition to New York’s public transport system. Launched in 2017, at time of writing this offers four lines, with two additional lines planned to open. There are 21 terminals and 23 boats in operation, connecting Manhattan with Brooklyn and Queens. Spiderman: Homecoming was shot here so it's a great place to check out.</p>

  <h2>Railway</h2>
  <img  src = "resources/rail.jpg" alt= "rail" class = "myimage"/>
          <div class = "mytext">
  <p>As well as the subway, there are a number of passenger railway lines operating around New York city. The majority of these are commuter focused lines designed to bring people into the city from the more distant boroughs, and they include the NYC suburban train, Staten Island Railway, New Jersey Transit, Port Authority Trans-Hudson, Long Island Railroad and Metro North Railroad. Unless you are planning on visiting one of the more distant part of the city, or have booked a hotel a long way from the main sights in New York, it’s unlikely you’re going to need to use one of these rail services. If you do, you will most likely have to buy a ticket for the individual journey at the train station. There is also an eticketing app called eTix, available for both Android and iPhone devices, which lets you buy tickets on your phone for the Metro-North Railroad or Long Island Rail Road. Fares will vary depending on the route you take.</p>
